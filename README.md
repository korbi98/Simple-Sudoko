# Simple-Sudoku
Simple Sudoku is a simple and lightweight implementation of a Sudoku game for android. The app was a learning project for me, so not everything might be done in the best possible way. You are invited to fork the project and to improve the code.

The app can be downloaded from here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.korbi.simplesudoku

I hope you enjoy the app
